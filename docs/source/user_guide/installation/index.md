## Setting up the yambo executables on AiiDA

In order to set up the p2y and yambo executables as an AiiDA codes, use the name ``yambo.yambo`` as the plugin name

```bash
$ verdi code setup

To setup a code (as well as a computer) in AiiDA there is also the possibility to define a YAML-format file (HERE REF To that part of the docs):

```bash 
---
label: "yambo-5.1"
description: "yambo v5.1"
input_plugin: "yambo.yambo"
on_computer: true
remote_abs_path: "path_to_yambo_folder/bin/yambo"
computer: "@cluster"
prepend_text: |
    ''module load ...
    export OMP_NUM_THREADS = ''

append_text: ""
```

To store the code, just type ``verdi code setup --config file.yml``.

Tip: for SLURM schedulers we suggest to set, in the prepend text of the computer (so, for all codes) 
or of the code (if you need case-sensitive settings) the following command:

```bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK 
```

This will automatically set the right number of threads. For PBS/Torque, you need to set the 
environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS `by using the prepend_text key in the `options` python dictionary 
of the calculation.
